Perl Modules included...

	DBD::MySQL 4.005

Changes...
	* Major Apache configuration changes [see below] *
	\www\webroot no longer exists --> \www\vhosts\localhost is now the default Apache DocumentRoot
	php.ini and my.ini moved from %WINDIR% to \www\php5 [PHPIniDir] and \www\mysql5 [intrinsic search path]

	Virtual Hosting:
		1) Added \www\vhosts directory. Use this as the directory base of your Virtual Hosts.
		2) Uncommented 'Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf' under httpd.conf. Use this as the configuration base of your Virtual Hosts.
		3) Added two example VHs: host1.tld and host2.tld under conf\extra\httpd-vhosts.conf and their respectful directories under \www\vhosts

	httpd Configuration Structure and Function:
		1) Modified configuration structure
			Moved files within conf\Suite-extra to conf\extra
			Renamed Suite specific configurations files to suite-*.conf
			Added conf\extra\other directory containing other sample configuration files

		2) Modified configuration function
			Updated configuration to reflect change of \www\webroot to \www\vhosts\localhost
			.htaccess files are now enabled by default [AllowOverride <level> still needs to be set for specific directories -- defaults to 'Limit']
			All *.conf files under conf\extra\vhosts\localhost are automatically loaded via localhost VH blocks for VH:80 [httpd-vhosts.conf] and VH:443 [httpd-ssl.conf]
			components.conf has been removed and it's role has been integrated under httpd.conf
			conf\extra\suite-custom.conf has been created for any custom changes that are not appropriate to httpd.conf

		3) Other
			Removed all instances of *.conf.default files as users where confusing them with the *.conf files
			Global 'AllowOverride' has been relaxed from 'None' to 'Limit'
			Global 'DefaultType text/plain' changed to 'text/html'
			Other minor changes

		4) PHP is now enabled for all vhosts [suite-php5.conf]

		5) Separate cgi-bin is now enabled for all vhosts that have a 'cgi-bin' directory --> \www\vhosts\*\cgi-bin

	php.ini:
		Enabled 'extension=php_curl.dll'
		Updated SMTP string from 'localhost' to 127.0.0.1 as apparently PHP will only take an IP or a FQDN here [win32 specific]
		'display_errors = On'

	other:
		\www\docs\ created and populated with Suite Guide, Apache2 Manual, mod_security2 guides; \www\WDC\suite-guide no longer exists
		webdeveloper.php renamed to docs.php; redirect location updated
		\www\WDC changed to \www\suite-data

Added...
	AWStats v6.7 log analyzer
	ZendDebugger.dll 5.2.10 to \www\php5\ext and appropriate changes to php.ini, commented out by default
	\www\docs now contains Suite Guide, Apache2 Manual, mod_security2 guides

Removed...
	analog: replaced with AWStats; looks like analog might have been abandoned
	mod_aspdotnet: if interested, use official msi to install
	mod_fastcgi: not enough interest right now, problems with Apache v2.2.6
	mod_perl: problems with Apache v2.2.6

Fixes...
	Moved out PHP FilesMatch security check from within the 'Location' directive, as this is not a valid scope.
	Updated expired example/test SSL certificates [new certs expire on 6/23/2010]

Known Problems...
	Windows Vista Users: Make sure to run the "Web Developer Controller" application as Administrator, either by selecting "Run as administrator" from the context menu or ticking "Run this program as administrator" in the compatibility tab of the properties of WDController.exe

	If your system has an Oracle DB installed, Apache will return:
		[error] Can't load Perl file: /www/Apache22/conf/Suite-extra/perl_extra.pl for server localhost:80, exiting...
	Edit C:\www\Apache22\conf\extra\mod_perl.conf to comment out line:
		PerlRequire "/www/Apache22/conf/extra/perl_extra.pl"

Notes...
	Directory permissions are set for Apache's default DocumentRoot [\www\vhosts\localhost] outside of the 'localhost' VH block due to...
		1) the fact that we are dealing with two 'localhost' VHs -- VH:80 [http] and VH:443 [https]
		2) and that this allows for user to comment out the inclusion of httpd-vhosts.conf [not recommended]

	Global 'AllowOverride' has been relaxed to 'Limit' [allows 'order allow/deny' within .htaccess] do to the fact that the other method of restricting access from directly within a VH block can present a problem when dealing with hosts that have both http and https

	URL '/private' is shared between all vhosts


v1.95 -- Released March 29, 2007

Important Notes:
	The default Apache [v2.2] Service has been renamed to "Apache2.2", from "Apache2"

		Configuration file: Suite-extra\mod_fastcgi.conf
		Default folder: \www\fcgi-bin\

Removed...
	Tomcat/mod_jk, PHP4, mod_aspdotnet have been removed. Will be packaged as component addons from separate downloads.

Fixes...
	Removed all log entries from httpd.conf and placed everything under mod_defalte_logio.conf. The original structure of the configuration had the effect of logging everything twice.
	Updated installer to double-quote 'include' path under php.ini
	Removed obsolete Dynamic DNS sub-section from Controller

Manual/Instructions...
	Updated Manual with minor corrections.

Known Problems...
	The MySQL database comes with all web framework applications' user/db pre-created, due to a problem Inno Setup is having with running a batch script that calls mysql.exe.

	phpBB2 from 2.0.22 over 2.0.21

Fixes...

		1) removed 'PmaAbsoluteUri' line, otherwise this would result in an 'unable to find server' error on some functions
		2) removed "$cfg['PmaNoRelation_DisableWarning'] = TRUE;" line, since the relation features have been implemented under our setup for some time

	MySQL seemed to have a 'Any' user left over with access to 'test' db. Removed user.

	WDController had a few issues that were resolved, such as a bad link to httpd-ssl.conf

Manual/Instructions...
		Updated Manual with minor corrections.

		Updated PHP4Downgrade.txt with 2 minor corrections...

v1.91 -- Released November 26, 2006

Version Updates...
	Apache 2.2.3 over 2.2.2
	PHP 5.1.5 over 5.2-dev

	DBD::mysql 3.0006_1 over 3.0004_1
	DBI 1.52 over 1.50

	HTML::Parser 3.55 over 3.54
	Digest::SHA1 2.11 new
	Net::SSLeay 1.30 new
	Crypt::SSLeay 0.51 new [does not seem to work]


New...

	Compiled and added PHP apache2handlers php5apache2_2.dll and php4apache2_2.dll to Suite

	Added Perl modules Net::SSLeay v1.30 and Crypt::SSLeay v0.51 [Crypt::SSLeay does not seem to work]

	Added Perl module Digest::SHA1 v2.11 -- not really needed [added to pass 'nmake test' steps of net::mysql and dbd::mysqlPP]


Fixes...
	Edited phpMyAdmin's config.inc.php -- previously, phpMyAdmin would not use this file as expected, due to syntax issue

	mod_security/phpmyadmin problems [changes to conf\modsec_rules\exclude.conf, for url '/phpmyadmin/']...
		1) Added directive 'SecFilterScanPOST Off' to allow table updates; for POST data greater than 1024 bytes [error msg 'Multipart: part header line over xxxx bytes']
		2) Excluded 2 'Generic SQL sigs' rules -- previously, these rules hindered functionality of phpMyAdmin [rule.conf -- #300015, #300016]

	Edited mod_php5.conf...
		1) replaced '<Location />' with '<Directory "/www/webroot">' block to prevent mod_php from executing cgi php-scripts and leaking into dirs outside of webroot
		2) example PHPIniDir directive should be outside '<Location>' and '<Directory>' blocks
		3) example PHPIniDir directive should point to a path of a dir, and not to a file path of php.ini

	Added a few test rules to mod_deflate_logio.conf -- that somehow never made it in from the older Suite config

	Added 'AddType text/html .php .php4 .php5 .pl .cgi' to cgi-bin.conf -- to make sure browser does not treat the output of a CGI *.pl or *.php request as content-type 'text/plain' or as a download file
	Note: script generated 'content-type' header will override this value [which is good]
	

Changes...
	Minor comment changes to httpd.conf

	httpd.conf, new security check -- if no php_module is loaded, Apache should return 'permissions denied' on *.php(4,5) requests under \www\webroot

	Updated mod_aspdotnet.conf...
		1) updated comments and added new directives
		2) moved out 'sampleapp' example into mod_aspdotnet_example.conf

	Removed perl functionality from mod_fcgid.conf -- never worked [this module might only be good for PHP]

	Minor updates to Tomcat's workers.properties file...
		1) updated 'java_home' to v1.5.0_07 over v1.5.0_06 [not important as env vars override this]
		2) added worker 'jkstatus' [but have NOT added status URI to mod_jk configs]

	Changed cgi functionality -- updated/changed cgi-bin.conf, mod_fcgid.conf, phpmyadmin.conf...
		1) inclusion of mod_cgi and mod_php can now co-exist [if both are included, mod_cgi will serve perl scripts but will return 'permissions denied' on *.php(4,5) requests]
		2) inclusion of mod_cgi and phpMyAdmin can now co-exist [if mod_php is not included, Apache will return 'permissions denied' on /phpmyadmin requests]
		3) inclusion of mod_fcgid can now co-exist with mod_php and phpMyAdmin [if mod_php is included, Apache will return 'permissions denied' on /fcgid-bin requests]

	Updated config files to take into account both mod_php5 and mod_php4
	
	httpd.conf, now includes, by default, config files cgi-bin.conf and analog.conf...
	By default config: all php-mod will execute under webroot, no php-cgi will execute under cgi-bin, all perl-cgi will execute under cgi-bin 

	Updated modsec.conf...
		1) removed line 'SecServerResponseToken Off' as this directive is depreciated under mod_security v1.9
		2) changed 'SecFilterDefaultAction' action to HTTP status code '406' - Not Acceptable, from '500' - 'Internal Server Error'

	Added to cgi-bin.conf line 'ScriptLog logs/cgi.log'

	Reverted back to php script file type of '.php' under cgi-bin, from '.cgi'

	Revised mod_aspdotnet.conf note on using .NET Runtime v2.0 -- some have reported success


Manual...
	Modified Sections...
		1) PREREQUISITES -- REQUIREMENTS FOR cgi-bin (mod_cgi) and fcgid-bin (mod_fcgid)
		Note: cgi-bin.conf and mod_fcgid.conf inclusion is now default

		2) PREREQUISITES -- REQUIREMENTS FOR Analog (Logfile Analyzer) online form-interface functionality
		Note: cgi-bin.conf inclusion is now default

		3) Important Notes -- Package
		Note: added note about similar dlls, that link against different versions of libs, that are present under PHP/MySQL (libmysql.dll), and OpenSSL/Apache/PHP(libeay32.dll, ssleay32.dll); and how PATH order might have effect

	Other non-significant updates and edits


Known Problems...
	Under IE, http://localhost/stats/anlgform.html, which will redirect to http://localhost/cgi-bin/anlgform.pl, will treat output of this perl script as a download file 'anlgform.pl'
	Note: this does not happen under Firefox, or any other browser, nor was this a problem with Analog v5 -- probably just IE brain damage, xml related (new to analog v6)
	Have put a workaround emplace with 'OUTPUT HTML', over default XHTML, under \www\analog\analog.cfg
