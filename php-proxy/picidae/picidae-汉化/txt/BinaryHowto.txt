== How to create a statically linked web2pici binary ==

To create a binary that is usable for others, it has to be statically linked. 

Install therefore the statifier software: http://statifier.sourceforge.net/

Then you may execute in your Terminal:
{{{
./configure
make clean
make
statifier web2pici web2piciStatic
bzip2 web2piciStatic
}}}
