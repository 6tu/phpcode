== Find the name of your PHP user ==

To find out the name of your PHP user you can run the following php-script on your Server

{{{
<?php

$uname = shell_exec ('whoami');
echo ("user name is: <b>$uname </b>");

?>
}}}

It is important to know the name of your PHP user, because you have to give it the sudo right to generate the picture in the visudo file.
